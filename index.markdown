Welcome to my personal page!

Starting of with an Raspberry Pi in 2012 I became a big fan of Linux and open source over the time. I like to play around with hardware and software and by this keep learning new stuff every day. You can see some of this at [Github](https://www.github.com/JuanJakobo).

In my free time I like to do trips with my road bike. You can see longer tours at [tours.johannsn.com](https://tours.johannsn.com).

Do you like [riddles](https://riddle.johannsn.com)?
